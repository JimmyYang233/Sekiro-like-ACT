# Sekiro-like-ACT
Since I am a fun of Sekiro:Shadow Die Twice, I would like to replicate the entire system in UE4, this is purely done by myself, with the help of internet resource
All animations are coming from online, please do not use for any business purpose
Below are the steps, just to remind me what I need to do next

1. Create a third person project(done)
2. Add Health and Posture UI for main player and enemy(done)
3. presss middle mouse to lock on enemy system(done)
4. basic walk/run animation blendspace(done)
5. jump system(not done)
6. dodge system(done)
7. 3 combo attack system(done)
8. spike system(done)
9. hit reaction system, include lay down and stand up(done)
10. block system(debugging)
11. rebound system
12. create a great enough AI
13. climb system

15. add sound(if I can find any)
